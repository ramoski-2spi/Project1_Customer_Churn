# Project: Customer Churn Prediction
This project analyzes customer data and builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

# Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

# Business Problem
Customer churn is a common challenge for subscription-based and service-oriented businesses, leading to significant revenue loss and higher marketing costs to replace lost customers. This project tackles the problem by using data-driven models to predict which customers are most likely to leave, empowering companies to intervene early with targeted retention strategies—turning reactive loss into proactive retention.

# Project Goal:
Predict customers likely to churn so the business can improve retention.

# Dataset
For this project, I used the Telco Customer Chrun dataset.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA showed the following key insights:

- The dataset is imbalanced, with significantly more non-churned customers than churned customers, which is an important consideration for model evaluation.

- Although no missing values were initially detected, converting the TotalCharges column to a numeric format revealed hidden missing values, highlighting the importance of proper data type validation during preprocessing.

- Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit a substantially higher churn rate compared to customers on longer-term contracts.

- Churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges, suggesting that pricing or perceived value may play a role in customer churn.

- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn, indicating that early-stage retention is critical.
