# Business Problem
Customer churn is a common challenge for subscription-based and service-oriented businesses, leading to significant revenue loss and higher marketing costs to replace lost customers. This project tackles the problem by using data-driven models to predict which customers are most likely to leave, empowering companies to intervene early with targeted retention strategies—turning reactive loss into proactive retention.

# Project Goal:
Predict customers likely to churn so the business can improve retention.
